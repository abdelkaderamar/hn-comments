# HN Comments
HN Comments is a browser extension to select and save comments from [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

## Why this extension?

Hackernews is one of my main source of news and information. The links and contents shared provide a good source of what happens in tech industry, science and society. In addition to shared links, the comments of the community (especially those of _Ask HN_) are also a valuable source of information and knowledge. I built this extension to select and save the comments I found interesting. 

## What I can do with this extension?

You can use _HN Comment_ for the following operations:
* Select a text and copy it to the extension's clipboard
* Extract all the comments containg links. Usually the best comments are those providing additional links or references
* Export the selected comments into one of the three formats: text, YAML or markdown
* Show the extension's clipboard
* Manage multiple Hackernews stories
* Edit the selected comment

## How to use the extension

1. Select a text and add it to the clipboard: just select a text and use _Add selection to HN clipboard_ in extension's contextual menu.
